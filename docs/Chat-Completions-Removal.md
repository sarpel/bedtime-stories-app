# Chat/Completions Format Complete Removal

## Summary

Removed all references to OpenAI's legacy `chat/completions` API format from the entire codebase. The application now exclusively uses the Responses API (`/v1/responses`) format.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Server (`backend/server.ts`)

#### Removed chat/completions endpoint handling (line 641-670)

- **Before**: Had conditional logic to format requests for both `/responses` and `chat/completions` endpoints
- **After**: Only supports `/responses` endpoint
- Removed the `else if (endpoint.includes("chat/completions"))` branch that formatted messages array

#### Removed chat/completions response parsing (line 817-829)

- **Before**: Had fallback parsing for chat completions response format with `data.choices[0].message`
- **After**: Removed this fallback, only supports Responses API output format

#### Removed chat/completions debug logging (line 749)

- **Before**: Logged `hasChoices: !!data.choices` in debug info
- **After**: Only logs `hasOutput: !!data.output` for Responses API

#### Removed batch processing fallback (line 1908-1911)

- **Before**: Had fallback to parse `data.choices?.[0]?.message?.content` format
- **After**: Removed this fallback entirely

#### Removed batch story creation fallback (line 2706-2708)

- **Before**: Checked for `data?.choices?.[0]?.message?.content` as fallback
- **After**: Removed this check, only uses Responses API output parsing

### 2. Frontend Utilities (`src/utils/titleGenerator.ts`)

#### Cleaned response parsing (line 87)

- **Before**: `const text = data?.text || data?.choices?.[0]?.message?.content || data?.response`
- **After**: `const text = data?.text || data?.response || ''`
- Removed chat/completions format from response chain

### 3. Tests (`backend/__tests__/server.test.cjs`)

#### Removed chat/completions mock (line 18-20)

- **Before**: Had mock response for `url.includes('chat/completions')`
- **After**: Removed entirely, only mocks `/responses` endpoint

### 4. Jest Configuration (`jest.config.cjs`)

#### Fixed test pattern matching

- **Before**: Only matched `.test.[jt]s` files
- **After**: Also includes `.test.cjs` and `.spec.cjs` patterns
- This ensures the `.cjs` test file is properly discovered

## Impact

### Positive Changes

✅ Eliminated confusion - AI no longer sees mixed API formats
✅ Cleaner codebase - removed ~50 lines of legacy fallback code
✅ Single source of truth - only Responses API format throughout
✅ Reduced maintenance burden - no need to support dual formats

### No Breaking Changes

✅ Application already uses Responses API as primary format
✅ All removed code was fallback/legacy support
✅ No user-facing functionality affected

## Verification

All chat/completions references removed from:

- ✅ Backend server logic
- ✅ Frontend utilities
- ✅ Test mocks
- ✅ Comments and documentation strings

Only legitimate "message" and "content" references remain for:

- Responses API format (which uses `output[].type === "message"` and `content[]` arrays)
- These are correct and part of the official Responses API structure

## Related Files

The migration documentation (`docs/OpenAI-API-Migration.md`) intentionally still contains chat/completions references for historical context and migration guidance. This is appropriate for documentation purposes.
